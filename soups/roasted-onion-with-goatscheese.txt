Servings	Serves 4 - Roasting the onions gives the soup a rich caramelised flavour that really hits the spot on a chilly day

Ingredients

800g yellow or white onions, sliced
4 tbsp olive oil
1l vegetable stock
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
1 tsp Marmite
handful parsley, roughly chopped
8 thick slices bread
100g soft vegetarian goat's cheese, cubed

Method

Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the onions in a roasting tin with the oil, salt and pepper. Give it a good stir, then roast for 45 mins, stirring halfway through, until the onions are tinged brown, but not burnt.
Tip the onions into a large pan with the stock, mustard and Marmite. Bring to the boil and simmer for 15 mins, then stir in the parsley. Toast 4 of the bread slices then scatter on the cheese. Ladle the soup into bowls, pop a toast into each and serve with the extra slices of bread on the side.
