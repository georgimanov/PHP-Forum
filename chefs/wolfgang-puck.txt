Wolfgang Puck net worth: Wolfgang Puck is an Austrian celebrity chef, restaurateur who has a net worth of $75 million dollars. An internationally famous chef, restaurateur, businessman, author, and actor, Wolfgang Puck oversees a vast cooking empire that includes books, 20 restaurants, celebrity catering services, including the Academy Awards, and various packaged foods and cooking-related products. Born Wolfgang Johannes Topfschnig on July 8, 1949, Puck has turned from a curious boy learning how to cook from his part-time pastry chef mother into a true celebrity chef to rival all others. He broadened his cuisine knowledge as an apprentice under Raymond Thuilier at Hotel de Paris in Monaco, after which he moved to the United States to pursue a chef career at the age of 24. However, he eventually settled in Los Angeles where he became both a chef and part-owner at Ma Maison restaurant. Since then, he has developed his business further, especially in the '80s with his modern take on pizza. As of today, his 20 fine dining restaurants, dozens of catering locations, several cookbooks and numerous licensed products are all run by Wolfgang Puck Companies, which has three divisions. Moving with the times, Puck has recently introduced his latest endeavor, i.e., an app that includes recipes, links to Puck's restaurants as well as help with party planning. What's more, he has been constantly active in philanthropic endeavors and charitable organizations, co-founding the Puck-Lazaroff Charitable Foundation in 1982.
