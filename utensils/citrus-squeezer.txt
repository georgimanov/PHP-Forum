Alessi 'Juicy Salif' Citrus Squeezer Miniature

Elegant and spider-like, this simple, but oh-so stylish Philippe Starck mini-citrus juicer is as much decoration as a functional utensil. Sitting smugly in a liquor cabinet (or shyly on your countertop), this little fella is a design quirk of nature and doesnâ€™t bite.
